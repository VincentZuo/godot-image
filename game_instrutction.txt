MUSEUM HEIST - Stealth Puzzler Game Instructions
==============================================

üéØ OBJECTIVE

üïµÔ∏è GAME MECHANICS

Turn-Based Movement:
- The game only advances when YOU move or take an action
- Guards patrol and cameras rotate ONLY after you make a move
- Take your time to plan each step - there's no time pressure!

Stealth System:
- Guards have cone-shaped vision areas (shown as light regions)
- If you step into a guard's line of sight, you'll be caught instantly
- Stay in the dark areas to remain hidden
- Each turn you stay hidden increases your stealth streak

Scoring System:
- Base Score = Artwork Value √ó Stealth Bonus Multiplier
- Stealth Bonus grows with your stealth streak: 1.0x + (streak √ó 0.1x)
- Example: 10-step stealth streak = 2.0x multiplier
- Bonus resets to 1.0x if you're spotted by a guard

üèõÔ∏è MUSEUM LAYOUT

Visual Elements:
- Dark Blue Tiles: Museum floors (safe to walk on)
- Dark Gray Tiles: Walls (impassable)
- Light Areas: Guard vision cones (DANGEROUS - avoid these!)
- Golden Rectangles: Valuable artworks to steal
- Green Circle (P): Your character
- Red/Brown Circles (G): Museum guards

Famous Artworks to Steal:
- Mona Lisa (1000 points)
- Starry Night (800 points)
- Venus de Milo (700 points)
- The Scream (600 points)
- The Thinker (500 points)

üõ°Ô∏è GUARD BEHAVIOR

Patrol Patterns:
- Each guard follows a predetermined route
- They move to the next waypoint after you move
- Guards face the direction they're moving
- Vision cones project forward from their facing direction
- Alert guards (shown in red) mean you've been spotted!

Vision System:
- Guards can only see in front of them (directional vision)
- Vision range: 3-5 tiles depending on the guard
- Line of sight is blocked by walls
- If ANY guard sees you, the heist fails immediately

üèÜ WINNING & LOSING

Victory Conditions:
- Steal ALL artworks in the museum
- Complete the heist without being detected
- Final score = total artwork value √ó accumulated stealth bonuses

Defeat Conditions:
- Any guard spots you in their vision cone
- Game ends immediately with "CAUGHT!" message

üíæ SAVE SYSTEM

Automatic State Saving:
- Every action saves the game state to JSON files
- Files named: game_state_step_1.json, game_state_step_2.json, etc.
- Game automatically loads the most recent save when restarted
- You can examine save files to analyze your progress

üéØ STRATEGY TIPS

Planning Your Route:
1. Study guard patrol patterns before moving
2. Wait for guards to move away from your target area
3. Plan an escape route before approaching artwork
4. Use walls to break line of sight

Maximizing Score:
- Build long stealth streaks for maximum multiplier
- Save high-value artworks for when you have big bonuses
- Never enter guard vision - even briefly ruins your streak

Advanced Techniques:
- Follow guards from behind (outside their vision cone)
- Use the turn-based nature to "pause" and analyze situations
- Guards are predictable - learn their routes
- Corner cutting: Guards can't see around walls
