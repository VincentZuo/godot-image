                          NEON LIGHT ROUTER - QUICK GUIDE
===============================================================================

🎯 OBJECTIVE
Route light beams to crystal wells using mirrors, prisms, and splitters.

🎮 CONTROLS
  W/A/S/D  - Move cursor
  SPACE    - Place/rotate optics (Empty → Mirror → Prism → Splitter → Empty)
  R        - New puzzle

📋 GAME ELEMENTS

🔹 BEAM SOURCES (Blue circles) - Emit colored light from grid edges
🔹 MIRRORS (Cyan lines) - Reflect light at 90° angles  
🔹 PRISMS (Magenta triangles) - Split white light into red/green/blue
🔹 SPLITTERS (Green crosses) - Split beams in perpendicular directions
🔹 CRYSTAL WELLS (Pink diamonds) - Your targets!

🏆 SCORING
• 100 points per well hit
• -2 points per step taken
• Score = (Wells × 100) - (Steps × 2)

💡 TIPS
• Study beam source positions first
• Use fewer steps for higher scores
• Prisms split white light into colors
• Splitters multiply beams to hit multiple targets

💾 AUTO-SAVE
Game saves after each move as game_state_step_X.json files.
